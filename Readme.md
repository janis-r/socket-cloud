# Socket cloud
A WebSocket based messaging platform with configurable data exchange protocol, access rights and external validators grouped within abstracted configuration scopes that can coexist on same instance without overlapping.

## What's in here:
### 1. WebSocket server compliant with [Autobahn test suite](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-testsuite).

### 2. Data exchange server that delivers pub/sub messaging by data channel or connection id with message retention and recovery.

### 3. External connectivity API to enable integration with third party services.

## Project status
Main functionality is developed and even tested but I've never got time finish all the small things and add integrations that would make sense and it does not look like that gonna change any time soon.
